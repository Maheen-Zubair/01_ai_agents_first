# 🧠 Multi-Agent Orchestration with OpenAI's Agents SDK & Anthropic Design Patterns

## 📘 Overview

This project explores the design and implementation of multi-agent systems using OpenAI’s **Agents SDK**, which builds upon the foundational concepts of the experimental **Swarm** framework. It also incorporates **proven design patterns** outlined by **Anthropic** to create robust, modular, and scalable AI agent workflows.

## 🔧 What is OpenAI's Swarm?

OpenAI's **Swarm** was an experimental framework designed for lightweight and ergonomic orchestration of multiple AI agents.

### 🧩 Core Concepts:
- **Agents**: Autonomous components with specific tools and instructions for defined tasks.
- **Handoffs**: A mechanism for passing control and context between agents.

Swarm introduced a minimal yet powerful approach to build **scalable and testable** collaborative agent-based systems.

## 🚀 OpenAI Agents SDK

The **Agents SDK** is the production-ready evolution of Swarm, enabling developers to:

- Orchestrate complex workflows across multiple agents.
- Coordinate agents with **handoffs**, **guardrails**, and **task chaining**.
- Easily integrate AI agents into real-world applications.

This SDK allows for structured agent behavior, dynamic routing, and collaborative task resolution using plug-and-play agent definitions.

## 📐 Anthropic Design Patterns for Effective Agents

OpenAI's Agents SDK aligns with design principles defined by Anthropic. These patterns enhance clarity, modularity, and performance in agent-based systems:

### 1. 🔗 Prompt Chaining
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps.
- Each agent handles one step in a sequence.

### 2. 🔀 Routing
- Dynamically route tasks to the most suitable agent.
- Achieved via **handoffs** in the Agents SDK.

### 3. ⚙️ Parallelization
- Execute independent subtasks concurrently.
- Improve performance and reduce latency.

### 4. 🧭 Orchestrator-Worker Pattern
- An orchestrator agent decomposes the task.
- Delegates subtasks to specialized worker agents.

### 5. 📊 Evaluator-Optimizer Loop
- An evaluator agent reviews outputs.
- Suggests optimizations or reruns based on performance.
- Supported by SDK’s **guardrails and feedback loops**.
